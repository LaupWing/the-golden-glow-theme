# Claude Context - The Golden Glow WordPress Theme

## Current Situation

The user has **50+ treatment pages** that are similar but not identical. They want to make these pages dynamic instead of creating 50 separate template files.

### Page Structure
- **Parent pages**: Spierontspanners, Fillers, Lasers, Biostimulatie, etc.
- **Child pages**: Bunny Lines, Frons Rimpels, Kraaienpootjes, etc. (under parent categories)

### User Requirements
1. Some pages have different sections/layouts (not all identical)
2. User will create an example page first so we can analyze the structure
3. Solution should be **simple and not overwhelming**

## What We're Waiting For

User is creating an **example page** to show:
- What sections each page has
- How content is structured
- What varies between pages
- What stays the same

## Next Steps

Once the user provides the example:
1. Analyze the page structure
2. Identify common patterns
3. Propose a **simple, clean solution** (no overwhelming code)
4. Implement step-by-step with user approval

## Important Notes

- Keep solutions SIMPLE
- Don't overwhelm with too much code at once
- User prefers practical, incremental approach
- Wait for example before proceeding

## Current Theme Setup

- Using Tailwind CSS
- Custom page templates (page-*.php format)
- Template parts in `/templates/` and `/sections/`
- WordPress + Local development environment
